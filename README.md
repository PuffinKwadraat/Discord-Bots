# MultiCube-Private
This repository contains all of the bot files. If you download the files, don't forget to replace some paramaters in the .ENV file, and NPM Install Puppeteer.
This NPM package is to big to push to GitHub. Furthermore, be aware that your version that you have downloaded will get outdated very fast, since every week atleast one update
is released.
