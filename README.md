# MultiCube-Private

This repository contains all of the bot files. If you download the files, don't forget to replace some paramaters in the .ENV file. Also, execute `npm i puppeteer`. after installing any of the files. This Node package is to big to push to GitHub, so it isn't present in the files. Puppeteer is essential for some commands, so the bot won't fire up when you just download the bots straigt away. After that, fill it in with the correct paramaters in the config.js file and you should be ready to go. Furthermore, note that files you download will get (probably) outdated fast, since the bots are WIP. And afcourse, if you are planning to really use this bot, don't forget to install Node.js.
