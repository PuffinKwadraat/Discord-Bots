# MultiCube-Private

This repository contains all of the bot files. These bots can be found in action in the Discord server in the link at the bottom of this page.

Here is a list of stuff you need to do, before the bots can start up:
- Download Node.js (currently the bots are fitted for v16.16.0 LTS)
- Create a .ENV file with your data. Check the template for this.
- Fill in the config file with your ID's etc. Check the template for this.
- NPM I Puppeteer in your console.

But note that your files may get outdated quite fast, because the bots are WIP. Because of this, we recommend you to download official versions, instead of commits. You can see the versions as LTS, and the commits as temporary. Not all commits are complete when they appear here, just a step closer to a newer version.
