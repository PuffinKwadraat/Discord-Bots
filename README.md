# MultiCube-Private
This repository contains all of the bot files. If you download the files, don't forget to replace some paramaters in the .ENV file. Also, execute `npm i puppeteer`. This Node package is to big to push to GitHub, so it isn't present in the files. Furthermore, be aware that your version that you have downloaded will get outdated very fast, since every week atleast one update the bots are WIP.
