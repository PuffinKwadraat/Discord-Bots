# Discord Bots

> [New](https://github.com/SVKruik/Discord-Bots-v2) repository

This is a legacy and deprecated repository for my first generation of Discord bots. This repository marked the very
beginning of my programming journey, and is something that will go in the history books. I removed a lot of files since
it's deprecation, to keep it clear, and remove duplicate files.

In the 'Bot Files' directory you can find the following bots:

- Alnus
- Ciconia
- Luscinia

Alnus is the one of the pioneers, and is very old. Ciconia and Luscinia are somewhat newer, and feature Docker and
modern features.
