# MultiCube - Bot Names

----------------------------------------

Our Discord server has a couple of bots. They are named in Latin after birds, so here is what they mean. Because we are a Dutch community, we also added their Dutch names.

- Anser: Goose, Gans
- Ciconia: Stork, Ooievaar
- Falco: Falcon, Valk
- Heron: Heron, Reiger
- Noctua: Night Owl, Nachtuil
