# MultiCube - Explain Bot

----------------------------------------

### Files

These contain all the data and commands that can be used. Their location cannot be changed, because it will break everyting.

### Folders

These contain all the files. There are a couple kinds of folders:
- [Commands](https://github.com/PuffinKwadraat/MultiCube-and-Child-Servers/tree/main/Discord%20Bot/Commands) = contains all the commands. They do not work without the command_handler.js file and a couple of other files.
- [Counters](https://github.com/PuffinKwadraat/MultiCube-and-Child-Servers/tree/main/Discord%20Bot/Counters) = contains all the counters in the Discord Server. For example the Member Counter.
- [Events](https://github.com/PuffinKwadraat/MultiCube-and-Child-Servers/tree/main/Discord%20Bot/Events) = contains important core files. The bot will not work without it. 
- [Handlers](https://github.com/PuffinKwadraat/MultiCube-and-Child-Servers/tree/main/Discord%20Bot/Handlers) = contains import core files. The bot will not work without it. 

Beside these four listed folders, there are a lot of other files, only available on the computer running the bot. If you need anything, contact our staff. Their location cannot be changed, because it will break everyting. 

### Information

Note that all of the files are useless on their own. These are just for documentation. Also, the bot doesn't work if you just download all the components. You need to fill in your own bot token. Furthermore, do not change any of the files if you are new into programming, or just Discord Bots. And finally, you need a couple of other 3rd party components for it to work. The PC running this bot is the only one that has access (changing and starting it up etc).
