# MultiCube - ReadMe
This main repository is dedicated to our server on Minecraft.<br/>

----------------------------------------

This file will be updated with new information and stuff.

----------------------------------------

### General Information
We run a couple of Minecraft Servers. We have Child (Sub) Servers, but our main focus is MultiCube. This server is still the largest, and most accessible. This is because
you don't have to download anything. You can just join and play. We have a subserver where there are Mods present, so be aware if you'd like to join, you have to download
the mods first! If you need help with that, contact our support team. You can find the needed Mods in the file 'Plugins and Mods.md'.

### Joining our servers
Most servers are just like any other public server fully joinable. But we have a couple of servers that have Mods. Like discribed above (General Information) you have to download them. If you want to know what servers have Mods, contact our support team.

### Ranks and Roles
If you want to apply for a Rank and/or Role, please fill in the [form](https://forms.gle/pabpqPiWeBp9aZ2a8). Note that for Roles like 'Builder' or 'Redstoner' aren't available for apply. These roles can be obtained by showing off you skill. If you want to be 'Redstoner', you have to be good with Redstone. If you are filling in the form, please tell us the truth. You can upload a picture of anything you have build and show us something. Be aware though that we can't have 100 Admins for example, so check if the Ranks/Roles aren't full. Also, if you want the Support Role/Rank, you have to be a longtime player and know how things work. You cant get the role if you are playing for a day or 2. Support means helping people, so you have to know how things work around our community.

### Support and Help
If you have questions about anything, you can contact our support team like said before. Check which people have the Support Role/Rank. Be polite and ask anything you'd like! If there's anything that can be done better/on another way or have suggestions, you can talk to people with Support Role or anything higher. Please, be clear about what you'd like to see change, and why.

### Rules
We have a few rules that are important. We want to keep this place nice, friendly and polite. Rule breakers will receive a warning, and if they continue, the will receive a ban/kick. Report rulebreakers to our staff. Read the server rules in-game (/mainmenu --> Server Rules), or on first join of the Discord server.

### Economy
Our Discord Server also has a Economy system. You can collect money through a couple ways:
  - Daily reward: as the name suggests, you can collect a DR. The command for this is `$dailyreward`, it has a cooldown of 24 hours (86400 seconds).
  - More to come
  - .
  - .<br/>

There are 2 types of balance:
  - Bank: you cannot pay with this, it's just an account for save keeping and saving up money.
  - Wallet: this is your direct payment method. All money earned (for example DR) goes into here.
The Economy System is not done, so this text about Economy will be expanded.
