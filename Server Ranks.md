##### Server Ranks (high to low)

----------------------------------------

- [^1]: __Owner:__ only one player can be this. Owner rank can be obtained by owning both the Discord Server, and the Minecraft Server. At this moment Complex, or PuffinKwadraat is the owner of the server. He has all the permissions on both servers. Afcourse, you're OP if you are owner.

- [^2]: __Co-Owner:__ Very high rank. Can only be given by the owner. You will get OP. For this you have to be a:
    - *Longtime* player (have a lot of experience on this server)
        - Since about the server's start. Before BÃ¨ta Version.
    - Know how both servers (MC and Discord) work.
    - Know the basics of: YML, Markdown and JS (Javascript).
    - Being a GitHub Collaborator, and writing new updates.
    - Being a overall active player. You don't have to play 24/7, but atleast a couple of times in a week. 
    - Being a teamplayer. So you have to be able to work in a team. In the end, this server started as a friend project, so without teamwork, we would be nowhere.

- [^3]: __Mythic:__ Also a high-tier rank. This is the highest rank on the server that earned Coins can buy (4000 Coins). With this rank there are many advantages:
    - Priority Speaker in Discord calls.
    - You will be informed as one of the first when new Server Events or anything like that will happen.
    - More permissions on the Minecraft Server. Ask a staff member for the precise additional permissions, since these are constanly changing and being updated.
    - Colorfull prefix and chat color!

- [^4]: __Legendary:__ High-tier rank
